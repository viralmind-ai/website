      <p class="font-bold">Subscriptions</p>
      <p><b>AUTOMATIC RENEWAL &amp; CANCELLATION</b></p>
      <p>VIRALMIND offers Users weekly subscriptions for enhanced user experiences. If you sign up for one or
        more subscriptions, your subscription(s) will automatically renew until you cancel, and you will
        automatically be charged the associated fee (plus any applicable taxes) until you cancel. To see your next
        renewal date and current fee, visit your mobile device’s account settings, or the Subscriptions tab that is
        available through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p>You must cancel your subscription(s) at least 24 hours before the end of your current billing period to
        avoid being charged for the next billing period. After cancellation, you will have access to your
        subscription(s) through the last day of your current billing period, at which point your subscription(s)
        (and access to your subscription’s features) will be discontinued.</p>
      <p>You may cancel your subscription(s) any time through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account. To
        access the subscription features after discontinuing your paid subscription, you may need to purchase a new
        subscription, subject to then-current fees, terms, and conditions.</p>
      <p><b>PAYING FOR YOUR CONNECTED SUBSCRIPTIONS</b></p>
      <p>Payments for your subscriptions are processed via Apple (for iOS) and Google (for Android) (each an “<b>App
          Provider</b>”) and you will need to provide your App Provider with your payment information. You are
        responsible for maintaining accurate and up-to-date payment information. If a payment is unsuccessful, we
        may suspend your access to the relevant subscription features until you provide a valid payment method.
        VIRALMIND is not responsible if your subscription fails to renew due to invalid payment information.</p>
      <p><b>REFUNDS</b></p>
      <p>Refund requests are handled by your App Provider, not VIRALMIND. To request a refund, you should follow
        your App Provider’s refund procedures. VIRALMIND does not offer refunds for your subscriptions. If you
        cancel, we will not issue you a refund or credit for any partial-period access to your subscriptions. You
        are not entitled to a refund or credit for any part of a billing period if the subscription features are
        unavailable, defective, experiencing delays, or for any other reason.</p>
      <p><b>CHANGES TO SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FEATURES</b></p>
      <p>We reserve the right to change or discontinue your subscription plans, subscription features, terms, or
        pricing at any time. VIRALMIND is not responsible for any damage or loss caused by failures or delays of
        your subscription or the subscription features.</p>
      <p><b>Eligibility and Use Restrictions</b></p>

      <p>THE VIRALMIND PARTIES SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR
        ANY LOSS, DAMAGE (WHETHER ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE), INJURY, CLAIM, LIABILITY, OR OTHER

      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold the VIRALMIND Parties harmless from and against any claims,
        liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        costs, arising out of or in any way connected to your use or misuse of the Services or with any of the

        behalf): (A) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Service; (B) your violation of any third-party
        right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property

      <p class="font-bold">Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver, Jury Trial Waiver</p>
      <p><b>Arbitration Agreement.</b> If you pursue a legal claim against VIRALMIND, you agree to arbitration
        (with limited exceptions and except where prohibited by law):</p>
      <p>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
        (including any alleged breach thereof) or our Services shall be binding arbitration administered by JAMS
        under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, except as modified by this Agreement.</p>
      <p>The one exception is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a
        small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request
        that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of the small
        claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of
        the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of
        the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the
        arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you choose
        arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against Iconic
        Hearts any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</p>
      <p>Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury, and the arbitrator shall
        determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before
        the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can and decisions by the arbitrator are
        enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
      <p>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or
        vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this
        arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against VIRALMIND
        (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Los
        Angeles County, California. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such
        purposes.</p>
      <p><b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE
          CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A
          CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</b>If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between
        you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.
      </p>
      <p><b>JURY TRIAL WAIVER.&nbsp;IF A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION,&nbsp;WE EACH WAIVE
          ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</b></p>
      <p class="font-bold">Limitations and modifications</p>
      <p>VIRALMIND will make reasonable efforts to keep the Services operational. However, certain technical
        difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory
        requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. VIRALMIND reserves the right,
        periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features
        of the Services, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited

        thereof. You understand, agree, and accept that VIRALMIND will make reasonable efforts, although it has
        no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Services, or to provide all or any specific
        content through the Services. VIRALMIND and/or the owners of any content may, from time to time, remove

      <p class="font-bold">General provisions</p>
      <p><b>Governing Law &amp; Venue.</b> These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with
        the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
        Act. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with
        VIRALMIND that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the
        federal or state courts of Los Angeles County, California. You and VIRALMIND consent to the exercise of
        personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of California and waive any claim that such courts constitute
        an inconvenient forum.</p>
      <p><b>Additional Terms.</b> Additional terms and conditions may apply to specific features or your use of
        certain portions of the Services. These additional terms also are legally binding.</p>
      <p><b>No Waiver.</b> Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and
        signed by or on behalf of VIRALMIND. No failure or delay by VIRALMIND in exercising any right,
        power, or privilege under these Terms will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
        exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
        any other right, power, or privilege under these Terms. This provision will survive the termination of any
        and all of your transactions with VIRALMIND.</p>
      <p><b>Severability.</b> Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, the invalidity or enforceability of any
        provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforcement of any other provision, all of which
        remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <p><b>Headings.</b> The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
        effect.</p>
      <p><b>Assignment.</b> VIRALMIND may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or
        without notice to you. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations
        under this Agreement without our express prior written consent.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement (which includes these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy and any
        other VIRALMIND terms that govern your use of Service), constitutes the entire agreement between you and
        VIRALMIND</p>
      <p class="font-bold">Changes</p>
      <p>We may revise and update these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. Notice of any material
        change will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. All changes are effective immediately
        upon posting by us and such changes shall apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter;
        provided, however, that any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law &amp;
        Venue will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or before the date the
        change is posted on the Services.</p>
      <p>Your continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree
        to such changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are
        binding on you.</p>
